# Exercise Tracker

This is the boilerplate for the Exercise Tracker project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker

Considerations

This is a toy project but it will go through the same review process as real-project code to make sure it not only meets the requirements but also follows best practice.

Architecture: what real-world objects are there in this project and how can they be modeled in code? What layers should we have? Good reading on Express-based Node.js application architecture can be found here and in this repository you can find an implementation example.

Can you have more than one user with the same username? The username should be unique. Empty username does not make sense either.

Does your api handle database errors gracefully? You likely do not want to show raw database error messages to your user.

Does it handle user input in a secure way (preventing SQL injections)?

Users can do weird things. Have you tried sending the date in a wrong format? Missing a required parameter?

Totally optionally but would be great to have unit tests.
